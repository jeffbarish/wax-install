Clone wax, wax-config, and wax-install (from the home directory):

git clone https://github.com/jeffbarish/wax.git) 
git clone https://github.com/jeffbarish/wax-config.git) 
git clone https://github.com/jeffbarish/wax-install.git) 

cd into wax-install and run the program "installer" as root:

sudo ./installer

It runs apt to install several packages. 

It will put starter scripts for wax and waxconfig in /usr/local/bin.

It puts the theme in ~/.themes.

It creates a virtual environment in ~/.venv and it activates it (you need
to run wax from the virtual environment).

It appends an alias va to .bash_aliases. Use it to activate the virtual
environment.

When the installer finishes, type "wax" to run wax or "waxconfig" to run
waxconfig.

I tested the code on Ubuntu 24.04 running on an Intel processor and on Debian GNU/Linux 12 (Raspberry Pi OS) running on Raspberry Pi 4B. Note that you will need GTK and GStreamer.

Do not run installer over an existing installation.
